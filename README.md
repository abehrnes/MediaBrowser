###What is [MediaPortal](http://www.team-mediaportal.com)?

MediaPortal is an open-source media center (HTPC) software project, often considered an alternative to Windows Media Center. It provides a 10-foot user interface for performing typical PVR/TiVo functionality, including playing, pausing, and recording live TV; playing DVDs, videos, and music; viewing pictures; and other functions. Plugins allow it to perform additional tasks, such as watching online video, listening to music from online services such asLast.fm, and launching other applications such as games. It interfaces with the hardware commonly found in HTPCs, such as TV tuners, infrared receivers, and LCD displays.
The MediaPortal source code was initially forked from XBMC, though it has been almost completely re-written since then. MediaPortal is designed specifically for Microsoft Windows,
 
MediaPortal also includes MPAR, which is a clever little addition that ensures that the playback of your videos is smooth - no more stuttering movies!
MediaPortal comes with a pretty stunning looking 'skin' (just look at those gorgeous screen shots). but you can also mix it up a little to make it even more to your liking, pop into the gallery to see how things can look. If you are looking for something a little more advanced, MediaPortal can connect to your AVR, to fully support Dolby Digital, DTS, and other HD formats; With the correct plugins it will even connect to your home automation system, allowing you to control things directly from MediaPortal. Current technologies are also supported, so you can sit back and enjoy that new Blu-Ray movie in full DTS in your own home, for the full cinema experience - and with our comprehensive plugins, new and emerging technologies will be supported.
